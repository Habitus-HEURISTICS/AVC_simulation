Todo list:

1. Crop selection model has a bug (or a feature?). The success_adjustment method reduces the probability of planting a crop you failed at by three times more than it increases the probability of planting a crop you succeeded at. This is just how the probability redistribution works. If we don't like it, we need to split the Decision up into two parts, success_adjustment and failure_adjustment, and give the influences different rates.

2. kwargs and args between Decisions/Influences not good

3. Clamping should be temporary.

4. Test crop selection rules against data from Dr. Fall -- turns out we have more data, just need to organize it and bin it appropriately.

5. Make it easier to add / remove crops and regions; right now you have to do it manually. I'm not sure there's a way around this, to be able to for example switch between rice/not rice and rice/onions/tomatoes/other/nothing. 

6. Sometimes you can write masks and influences such that there's no possible option for harvest. Need to supply a warning when this happens, otherwise you'll spend another four hours tracking down a "bug". 

7. Limited resources for labor and for seed.

8. Market information: International prices and urban consumers
